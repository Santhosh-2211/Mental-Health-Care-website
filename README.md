# Mental-Health-Care-website
Mental health web application helps people in need of proper mental health guidance connect with authorized counsellors . Our web application acts as a one-stop-shop for one’s mental health resources, whether that be hotlines, resource centers, or even to search and book potential counsellors. The users will be also able to view/post reviews of the counsellors, thus having better clarity when choosing a counsellor. Thus we can help build a platform, which improves one’s attitude towards self-help and help-seeking, ultimately assisting towards improved wellbeing.
